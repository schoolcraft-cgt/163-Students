Test assignment repository for Students - C. Inman

Try your hand a GIT.

Git is a versioning system that allows you to keep a history of all the changes you make to a project.

Allowing you to go back and forth between version in the event something goes wrong along the way.

NOTE TO STUDENTS:

I am trying something new out for students who I feel could use a challenge. 

Introducing [Github Classroom](https://classroom.github.com). 

First I recommend you [sign up](https://github.com/join?source=header-home) for a free Github account.

Then [download](https://desktop.github.com/) the free Github App.

Next follow [this link](https://classroom.github.com/assignment-invitations/29970f3e26dc6e639548659f8d1c324b) to accept the test assignment on Github Classroom.

See if you can clone the repository using the Desktop App, and then try to "commit" any single file to the Github repository I have provided.

A successful COMMIT and PUSH will show up on your Github Page.

Give it a try... if you are up for the challenge!
